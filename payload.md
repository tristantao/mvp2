Welcome to your first data project! Here you will learn several tools for data analysis, build models, and do exploratory analysis! This project is taken from Kaggle, a data science competition website. The project is called Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster.

You are tasked to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic crash. You are given two datasets (Train & Test) each of which include predictor variables such as Age, Passenger Class, Sex, etc. With these two data sets we will do the following:

1. Create a model which will predict whether a passenger survived using only the Train data set
2. Predict whether the passengers survived in the Test data set based on the model we created

Taking a brief look at the data first is always a good move to get yourself familiarized. You can use the following
function to see the first six rows and all the columns of the data.

```R
head(trainData)
```

Now is actually a good time to put the datasets you are working with into R.
